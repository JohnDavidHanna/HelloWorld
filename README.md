#Lonely Jack
Seems like a reasonable title for a short story.
My books are all about the AI that runs this solar system and the Lonely Jack story will take place after the AI has been contacted and some changes have taken place but life remains life.
Jack's wife has left him keeping him in reserve with the ubiquitous 'finding herself' line as she leaves and he is at a loss as to what to do. Of course, after 834 years of marriage in the year 3732 he should be able to find some amusement.
